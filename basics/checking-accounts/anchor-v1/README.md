# Checking Accounts (Anchor)

> [!NOTE]
> This is the **Anchor v1** copy of this example, kept for programs staying on the
> Anchor v1 LTS line. Every `anchor` command on this page needs the v1 CLI:
> `avm install 1.1.2 && avm use 1.1.2`. The Anchor v2 version of this example is in
> [`../anchor`](../anchor/).

Validate that accounts passed into an [instruction](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#instruction) meet signer, owner, and address constraints before handler logic runs.

See also: [Checking Accounts overview](../README.md) and the [repository catalog](../../../README.md).

## Major concepts

- Account constraints in Anchor
- Signer vs mut vs address checks

## Setup

From this directory (`basics/checking-accounts/anchor/`):

```bash
anchor build
```

Prerequisites: [Agave](https://docs.anza.xyz/) CLI (version in `Anchor.toml` `[toolchain]`), [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs).

## Testing

Tests run in-process with [LiteSVM](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/testing/litesvm). No local validator.

```bash
anchor test
```

This runs `cargo test` as configured in `Anchor.toml`. Tests call instruction handlers and check onchain state.

## Usage

Read the program `programs/` source and `Anchor.toml` for deployed program IDs. For deployment, use `anchor build && anchor deploy` against your target cluster.
