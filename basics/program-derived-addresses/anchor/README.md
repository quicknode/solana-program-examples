# Program Derived Addresses (Anchor)

> [!NOTE]
> This is the **Anchor v2** copy of this example. Every `anchor` command on this page
> needs the v2 CLI: `cargo install anchor-cli --version 2.0.0-rc.1 --locked` (avm has
> no prebuilt binary for this pre-release). The Anchor v1 version of this example is in
> [`../anchor-v1`](../anchor-v1/).

Derive and use PDAs as deterministic account addresses for program-owned state.

See also: the [repository catalog](../../../README.md).

## Major concepts

- PDA derivation with seeds
- Storing state at a PDA

## Setup

From this directory (`basics/program-derived-addresses/anchor/`):

```bash
anchor build
```

Prerequisites: [Agave](https://docs.anza.xyz/) CLI (version in `Anchor.toml` `[toolchain]`), [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs).

## Testing

Tests run in-process with [LiteSVM](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/testing/litesvm). No local validator.

```bash
anchor test
```

This runs `cargo test` as configured in `Anchor.toml`. Tests call instruction handlers and check onchain state.

## Usage

Read the program `programs/` source and `Anchor.toml` for deployed program IDs. For deployment, use `anchor build && anchor deploy` against your target cluster.
