# Changelog

## 2026-08-04

Reject oracle prices from before a cluster restart. A halt stops the slot
count but not the wall clock, so after a restart a feed can look fresh in
slots while its price is hours old; with leverage that error is amplified
market-wide. `read_oracle_price` now also requires the feed's slot to be
after the `LastRestartSlot` sysvar's slot (`PricePredatesRestart`). Tested
by `test_open_rejects_price_from_before_a_restart`.
