# TypeScript Guidelines

These guidelines apply to TypeScript unit tests, browser code, Solana Kit clients, and any other places where TypeScript is used in the project. Read this alongside the general rules in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## General TypeScript

Use `"type": "module"` in `package.json` files.

Avoid using a `tsconfig.json` unless it's needed, as we use `tsx` to run most typescript and it doesn't usually need one. If you do need a `tsconfig.json`, state why at the top of the file, and you can use the most modern version of ECMAScript/JavaScript you want - up to say 2023.

## Async/await

Favor `async`/`await` and `try/catch` over `.then()` or `.catch()` or using callbacks for flow control. `tsx` has top level `await` so you don't need to wrap top level `await` in IIFEs.

## Type System

- **Always use `Array<item>`**, never use `item[]` for consistency with other generic syntax like `Promise<T>`, `Map<K, V>`, and `Set<T>`
- **Don't use `any`**

## Comments

- Most comments should use `//` and be above (not beside) the code
- The only exception is JSDoc/TSDoc comments which MUST use `/* */` syntax

## Solana-Specific TypeScript

- Don't make new `@solana/web3.js` version 1 code. Do not make new code using `@coral-xyz/anchor` package. Don't replace Solana Kit with web3.js version 1 code. web3.js version 1 is legacy and should be eventually removed. Solana Kit used to be called web3.js version 2. Use Solana Kit, preferably via Solana Kite.
- Use Kite's `connection.getPDAAndBump()` to turn seeds into PDAs and bumps
- There is no need to use offsets that you set to decode Solana account data - either download an npm package for the program like `@solana-program/token` for the token program or make one using Codama.
- In Solana Kit, you make instructions by making TS clients from IDLs using Codama. You can easily make Codama clients for installed IDLs using:

`npx create-codama-clients`

- Do not use the `bs58` npm package.

Don't do this:

```typescript
import bs58 from "bs58";
const signature = bs58.encode(signatureBytes);
```

Do this instead:

```typescript
import { getBase58Decoder } from "@solana/codecs";
const signature = getBase58Decoder().decode(signatureBytes);
```

Yes, `bs58` and `@solana/codecs` packages have different concepts of 'encode' and 'decode'.

## Unit Tests

- Create unit tests in TS in the `tests` directory
- Use the Node.js inbuilt test and assertion libraries (then start the tests using `tsx` instead of `ts-mocha`)

**Unit testing imports:**

```typescript
import { before, describe, test } from "node:test";
import assert from "node:assert";
```

- Use `test` rather than `it`

## Thrown object handling

- JavaScript allows arbitrary items - strings, array, numbers etc to be 'thrown'. However you can assume that any non-Error item that is thrown is a programmer error. Handle it like this (including the comment since most TypeScript developers don't know this):

```ts
// In JS it's possible to throw *anything*. A sensible programmer
// will only throw Errors but we must still check to satisfy
// TypeScript (and flag any craziness)
const ensureError = function (thrownObject: unknown): Error {
  if (thrownObject instanceof Error) {
    return thrownObject;
  }
  return new Error(`Non-Error thrown: ${String(thrownObject)}`);
};
```

and

```ts
try {
  // some code that might throw
} catch (thrownObject) {
  const error = ensureError(thrownObject);
  throw error;
}
```
